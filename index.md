# IOT MAILBOX FOR GMAIL
In the digital age, people naturally grows more reliant on technological advancements. Mail is no exception to this: Emails are a hundred times more common and convenient. My project will attempt to combine features of physical and digital mail.

# First Milestone

My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I set up the databases necessary for my mailbox to function. I used a website called Adafruit IO, and Zapier. The Adafruit is the code linked to the mailbox, while Zapier sends emails to Adafruit to process. I realized that Zapier doesn't support GMAIL functionality anymore.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the MyServo feature and the ESP36 and all the necessary components. One of the mailboxes main features is the flag, which turns when the mailbox opens, which indicates a new email. To make sure the flag will turn, the MyServo is a gear that has to be tested. I made it so that the code in the arduino will spin the MyServo.
