# Final Milestone

For my final milestone, I made modifications to my project. I added an LCD screen to the mailbox, which allows users to see how much mail has been processed since last checked.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I set up the databases necessary for my mailbox to function. I used Adafruit IO to process the emails, and Zapier to get them. The Adafruit is the code linked to the mailbox, while Zapier sends emails to Adafruit to process. I realized that Zapier doesn't support GMAIL functionality anymore.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the MyServo feature and the ESP36 and all the necessary components. One of the mailboxes main features is the flag, which turns when the mailbox opens, which indicates a new email. To make sure the flag will turn, the MyServo is a gear that has to be tested. I made it so that the code in the arduino will spin the MyServo.
